# Tower of Hanoi

The mission is to move all the disks to some another tower without violating the sequence of arrangement. A few rules to be followed for Tower of Hanoi are −

1 - Only one disk can be moved among the towers at any given time.
2 - Only the "top" disk can be removed.
3 - No large disk can sit over a small disk.

The steps to follow are −

Step 1 − Move n-1 disks from source to aux
Step 2 − Move nth disk from source to dest
Step 3 − Move n-1 disks from aux to dest

## Algorithm

A recursive algorithm for Tower of Hanoi can be driven as follows −

```
START
Procedure Hanoi(disk, source, dest, aux)

   IF disk == 1, THEN
      move disk from source to dest             
   ELSE
      Hanoi(disk - 1, source, aux, dest)     // Step 1
      move disk from source to dest          // Step 2
      Hanoi(disk - 1, aux, dest, source)     // Step 3
   END IF
   
END Procedure
STOP
